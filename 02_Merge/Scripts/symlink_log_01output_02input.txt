## These are commands I'd used to create symlinks for the input of 02_Clean. It links to the output of 01_Import_HRS.

#!/bin/bash

# Path to the original file
original_file="/Users/CatDang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-NorthwesternUniversity/Northwestern/Coursework/SPRING_2024/SOC_401_Categorical_Regression/Final_project_HRS_Spousal_death/01_Import_HRS/Output/widowhood_survey.csv"

# Path where the symbolic link should be created
symlink="/Users/CatDang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-NorthwesternUniversity/Northwestern/Coursework/SPRING_2024/SOC_401_Categorical_Regression/Final_project_HRS_Spousal_death/02_Merge/Input/widowhood_survey.csv"

# Create the symbolic link
ln -s "$original_file" "$symlink"

# Check if the symbolic link was created successfully
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Symbolic link created: $symlink -> $original_file"
else
    echo "Failed to create symbolic link"
