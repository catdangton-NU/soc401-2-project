This repository contains all the statistical code I used to turn raw data from the Health and Retirement Survey into final paper outputs.

## How to navigate

### 1. Task folders

Each numbered folder (e.g. 01_Import_HRS, 02_Merge, 03_Clean) contains the Input, Scripts and Outputs for a single data analysis task.

To see my code, go to Scripts.

### 2. Homework files

This folder contains all Quarto documents and rendered files I created to complete course assignments. The project proposal and final project paper will be stored here as well.

The input data for these documents are linked from the latest numbered task folder (e.g. 03_Clean).
